# Hello there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Kai.
Fulltime DBA, study business IT in the evening and do stuff in my homelab.

### In my homelab I've worked mainly with:
linux systems, </br>
running proxmox hypervisor, </br>
docker containerization,</br>
synology backup,</br>
unifi networking.</br>

### My up and running projects:
Nextcloud, with domain management, HTTPS certificates and traefik reverse proxy.</br>
Synology 3-2-1 backup solution.</br>
GIT server for my private dev repos.</br>

### What I am tinkering with:
OpenStack - Private Cloud for my compute ressources and heavy automation of infrastructure deployment.</br>
NeoVIM + TMUX - More efficient work with linux system adminstration and scripting.</br>

### On my To-Do list:
Ansible or Terraform - Automation of server patching, initialization like SSH, security config, etc.</br>
prometheus + grafana - Full monitoring and automated pickup of new servers. (Maybe even with a VOIP and messaging system)</br>
Ceph - Storage without the single point of failures.</br>
MaaS - PXE booting of hardware</br>

Stonktrades - Getting my trading trainings plattform on a server and running 24/7</br>
